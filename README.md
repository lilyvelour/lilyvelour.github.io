###### _This repository has been forked from [nuztalgia/nuztalgia.github.io][upstream]. All links have been adjusted for my own profile. Original text below:_

This repository holds the main [GitHub Pages][gp] site for my user account.
Currently, it consists of a single blank page that simply redirects to [my
GitHub profile]. It exists purely to provide a few [`rel="me"`] links for
identity verification on other websites (such as my [Mastodon] page and my
[Pronouns] page[^1]). Thank you [@simonw] for the awesome [walkthrough][wt]!
